# Python Clicker Game Library
This is a personal passion project 

# Goals:

Making a functional library 

Beta Version

Better test library


# UNDERSTAND THE SEPERATE LIBRARIES BEFORE USE

library_Raw.py doesnt work like a library the same way Library_A.py does
Find out the perks and downsides in the library_Raw section at the bottom of the README

Library_A.py is the main library for the while and may experience alot of changes 
and will seperate into two versions later these new versions being:

# Library_Beta: 
"Final product" having only the basic functionalities and taking up less processing
these are the perks of Library_Beta:

+ Only a few performance fixes and refurbishes to the code to make it lighter/faster.

+ Easier to use/Less complicated features.

+ Less bugs or breaks in code.

+ Faster fixes: due to the reasonable size it will be easier to fix.

- Less Features

- Less Beginner friendly (still beginner friendly just less)

overall this version is good for people just wanting to mess with it
might be better for the people who dont like too many choices
better for the people who get overwhelmed

# Library_Omega: 
The main line that gets updated with features when im able to and migth become bigger as time goes
these are the perks of Library_Omega

+ Better/More features

+ More reliable

+ More recent changes

+ More customisable

- Bulkier

- Less compact

overall if you like the additions i make go with this
and might also be easier for beginners if they can handle all the features

# Library_Raw:

- Not being tested/hasnt been tested since made

- doesnt have own class / you have to make your own class

+ runs by itself

- loses functions

+ still has some of the original functions

- bigger and bulkier

- less clean

- might have unknown bugs

overall if enough people want me to make this more like library_A i will fix it but this isnt being reworked
mostly deprecated unless it becomes popular
i did add this with not too many changes so unfinished code can be found there
